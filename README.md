# Agent-Based True Crime Content Generation Pipeline

An **agentic AI pipeline** that automatically generates documentary-style video assets (script, images, and narration) from real-world crime cases.

The system uses a multi-step workflow powered by **LangGraph**, where an AI agent selects a topic, gathers information, and generates consistent multimedia content.

---

## What It Does

Given an optional input topic, the pipeline:

1. Selects a real true-crime case (or uses user input)  
2. Retrieves factual information from Wikipedia  
3. Generates a structured narration script using an LLM  
4. Splits the story into scenes  
5. Generates realistic documentary-style images  
6. Generates voice narration using text-to-speech  
7. Exports all assets for video creation  

---

## Key Idea

This project focuses on **agent-based workflows**, where:

- Each step is handled by a node in a LangGraph pipeline  
- The system makes decisions (topic selection, filtering, structuring)  
- Outputs are kept aligned across text, images, and audio

## Tech Stack

- **LangGraph** – agent workflow orchestration  
- **Transformers (Hugging Face)** – LLM + TTS  
- **Stable Diffusion (SDXL Turbo)** – image generation  
- **Bark** – text-to-speech  
- **PyTorch** – model execution  
- **Wikipedia API** – factual data source

## How to Run

### Option 1: Notebook

```python
from pipeline import run_pipeline

state = run_pipeline("")
```

## Example Output

  case_name_timestamp/
    story.txt
    sections.json
    img_01.png
    img_02.png
    audio_01.wav
    audio_02.wav
    manifest.json

## Current Limitations / Work in Progress

- Image generation is not always perfectly consistent with the story
- Audio narration can sometimes sound unnatural or misaligned
- Outputs may occasionally drift from the selected topic
- Final video stitching is not yet implemented

This project is still being improved to increase consistency, realism, and reliability across all generated assets.

## Future Improvements

- Automatic video generation (combine images + audio into final video)
- Improved consistency between script, images, and narration
- Better topic selection and filtering
- Optional UI or web interface
